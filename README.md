ReadMe file for my Project for the Programming & Scripting module.

**Summary:**  
Fisher’s Iris dataset contains records on the length and width measurements for the Iris flower dataset of the following three Irish species: Iris setosa, Iris virginica, and Iris versicolor.  
It was created by Sir Ronald Aylmer Fisher, a statistician and geneticist, and was first published in a report in 1936 entitled “The Use of Multiple Measurements in Taxonomic Problems” in the journal Annals of Eugenics.  
Fisher used a linear function to differentiate between the three different Iris species based on the morphology of their flowers. 150 samples are contained in the data set, and the measurements were taken in centimetres.  
Records were recorded under 5 attributes - Petal Length, Petal Width, Sepal Length, Sepal Width and Class(Species).  
The data set is also known as Anderson's Iris data set, as the data was collected by Edgar Anderson and not Fischer himself, as well as the Iris flower dataset.  


**Project Progression**  
To begin with, I spent some time researching how to import the dataset and apply column names to the file I was working with (as these were not on it originally). I learned that I needed to import the pandas module to do this and create a dataframe. I then started researching previous analysis that had been done on the dataset as I tried to decide what exactly I wanted my project to show.  
The general consensus seems to be that the different attributes enable us to distinguish the different species of flower from each other, so I started testing how I could show this in my project.  
I began by using the describe, shape and value counts to produce some basic statistics on the dataset. I then had to do some more research to figure out how I would be able to analyse the data relating to the three individual species of flower, and found I needed to use the "loc" function.  
I'm still really playing with the data and have not produced any plots yet, but I feel I am getting more confortable with the data and should move onto plots in the next few days.
