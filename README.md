ReadMe file for my Project for the Programming & Scripting module.

**Summary:**  
Fisher’s Iris dataset contains records on the length and width measurements for the Iris flower dataset of the following three Irish species: Iris setosa, Iris virginica, and Iris versicolor.  
It was created by Sir Ronald Aylmer Fisher, a statistician and geneticist, and was first published in a report in 1936 entitled “The Use of Multiple Measurements in Taxonomic Problems” in the journal Annals of Eugenics.  
Fisher used a linear function to differentiate between the three different Iris species based on the morphology of their flowers. 150 samples are contained in the data set, and the measurements were taken in centimetres.  
Records were recorded under 5 attributes - Petal Length, Petal Width, Sepal Length, Sepal Width and Class(Species).  
The data set is also known as Anderson's Iris data set, as the data was collected by Edgar Anderson and not Fischer himself, as well as the Iris flower dataset.  


**Project Progression**
Spent some time researching how to import the dataset by column name and learned I needed the pandas module to do this.
